ðŸ”¹ Technical Leadership & Architecture

Q1: How do you approach architecting a scalable React application?
Answer:
I start by analyzing the application's complexity and growth expectations. Then I:

Break down the UI into reusable components following atomic design principles.

Use React Context API or Redux for scalable state management.

Separate concerns clearly: components, services (API layer), and utilities.

Apply lazy loading and code splitting to improve performance.

Enforce folder and file naming conventions and documentation.

Integrate TypeScript for type safety, enhancing code maintainability.

ðŸ”¹ React & Frontend Development
Q2: How do you manage state in a large-scale React application?
Answer:
I use a mix of:

Local state: via useState and useReducer for component-level logic.

Context API: for lightweight global needs like theme or auth.

Redux (or Zustand/MobX): for more complex shared states across the app.

I ensure side effects are handled using Redux-Saga or RTK Query.

Memoize selectors and use useMemo/useCallback for performance.

Q3: What are some performance optimizations you apply in React apps?
Answer:

Use React.memo to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

Debounce inputs (especially in search-heavy UIs).

Code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense.

Virtualize long lists using libraries like react-window.

Optimize images and use SVGs when applicable.

Minimize and lazy-load third-party libraries.

Q4: Whatâ€™s your experience with TypeScript in React projects?
Answer:
Iâ€™ve used TypeScript extensively to:

Enforce prop types and ensure contract validity between components.

Define global types and interfaces for consistency.

Reduce runtime errors and improve IDE auto-completion.

Enable better collaboration between frontend and backend via type definitions of API responses.

ðŸ”¹ Testing & CI/CD
Q5: How do you ensure code quality and maintainability?
Answer:

Write unit tests with Jest and integration/E2E tests with Cypress.

Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting.

Set up Git hooks with Husky to run checks before commits.

Use CI pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) to automate builds and run tests on each PR.

Conduct regular code reviews, focusing on readability, test coverage, and performance.

ðŸ”¹ Leadership & Mentorship
Q6: How do you lead and mentor a React development team?
Answer:

Conduct regular code reviews and pair programming sessions.

Organize biweekly knowledge-sharing sessions.

Encourage adoption of best practices via internal documentation and reusable patterns.

Act as a tech sounding board, help unblock devs, and escalate where needed.

Monitor performance and provide constructive feedback for improvement.

Q7: How do you handle disagreements within the dev team?
Answer:

Encourage open discussion and data-driven decisions (e.g., metrics, benchmarks).

Promote empathy and active listening.

Align the decision with business goals and long-term maintainability.

If unresolved, facilitate a vote or escalate to architecture leads or stakeholders for final direction.

ðŸ”¹ Collaboration & Agile
Q8: How do you work with designers and product managers?
Answer:

Participate in grooming sessions to clarify feasibility and technical constraints.

Collaborate early in the design phase for accessibility, responsiveness, and performance considerations.

Maintain a shared design system to ensure consistency.

Give realistic time estimates and flag risks early.

Q9: Describe your experience with Agile and task management tools.
Answer:

Iâ€™ve led teams in Agile environments using Jira and Confluence.

I conduct daily stand-ups, retrospectives, and sprint planning.

Track velocity and use burndown charts to ensure progress.

I use Jira dashboards for real-time visibility and status updates.

ðŸ”¹ Preferred Skills
Q10: Have you used Next.js in your projects?
Answer:
Yes, Iâ€™ve used Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation. It improves SEO, performance, and reduces the initial load time. Iâ€™ve integrated it with API routes, image optimization, and dynamic routing.

Q11: Do you have experience with GraphQL and Apollo Client?
Answer:
Yes. Iâ€™ve implemented GraphQL APIs and used Apollo Client in React apps for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management. I prefer GraphQL over REST when dealing with complex relational data due to its flexibility and reduced over-fetching.

Q12: How do you keep up with frontend trends?
Answer:
I regularly:

Follow key React and frontend newsletters (like React Status, JavaScript Weekly).

Attend tech conferences and local meetups.

Explore RFCs and changelogs for React/TypeScript.

Contribute to open-source and write tech blogs to reinforce my learning.
